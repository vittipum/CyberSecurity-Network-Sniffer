## Usage

Using the CyberSecurity Network Sniffer is straightforward. Once installed, you can run the scanner with a simple command.

### Basic Command

To start scanning your local network, use:

```bash
python sniffer.py
```

This command will begin the scan and display a list of devices connected to your network.

### Command Line Options

You can customize your scan using various command line options:

- `-h`, `--help`: Show help message and exit.
- `-i`, `--interface`: Specify the network interface to use (e.g., `eth0`, `wlan0`).
- `-r`, `--range`: Define the IP range to scan (e.g., `192.168.1.1/24`).

### Example Command

To scan a specific interface and range, you can run:

```bash
python sniffer.py -i wlan0 -r 192.168.1.0/24
```

This command scans the specified range on the given interface.

## Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the CyberSecurity Network Sniffer effectively:

### Scanning the Entire Network

To scan the entire local network, simply run:

```bash
python sniffer.py
```

You will see output similar to:

```
Scanning...
Device 1: IP - 192.168.1.10, MAC - 00:14:22:01:23:45
Device 2: IP - 192.168.1.11, MAC - 00:14:22:01:23:46
...
```

### Specifying an Interface

If you want to scan a specific network interface, use the `-i` option:

```bash
python sniffer.py -i eth0
```

### Scanning a Specific IP Range

To limit your scan to a specific range, use the `-r` option:

```bash
python sniffer.py -r 192.168.1.0/24
```
